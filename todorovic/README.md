# Files from Alexander Todorovic

This folder contains work done by Alexander Todorovic, from the scripting team.

A. Todorovic was absent for the entire duration of the project,
because of personal issues, so he was unable to keep up with 
other's work.

He was initially assigned to the scripting team, but due to absence of
whatsoever communication from/to/with Marco Conterno, his team leader,
A. Todorovic was unable to provide these pages in time using an 
appropriated Jekyll format.

These pages also overlaps with others done by other team members who
volunteered to help the scripting team deliver the contents in time.

For these reasons, everything in this folder is not in the
website and is kept just for grading purposes.
