<p>
Did you ever hear the tragedy of <b>Darth Plagueis</b> <i>The Wise</i>?<br>
<code>I thought not</code>. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you.</br>
It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith,
so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to <u>create life…</u><br>
He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.<br>
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.<br>
He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did.<br>
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.<br>
<b>Ironic</b>. He could save others from death, but not himself.<br>
