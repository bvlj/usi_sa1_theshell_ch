<p> Why Learning the Unix Shell? <br>
This is the question that you probably asked yourself
the first time you saw someone doing something with it.<br>
Well, Unix Shell is actually a must have skill for any well respectable computer scientist.
There are indeed several reasons to learn using it, here are some:

<ul>
    <li> It is the only way to communicate with servers, because they donâ€™t have a graphical user interface. </li>
    <li> You can program in the Shell! Unix Shell provides a set of special commands that can be used to create Scripts.
        Scripts are programs that can execute in a loop a series of commands. You can even create scripts that automatically fix your code!</li>
    <li> You look like a hacker, when you use it! (If you really want to look like a pro, go to settings and make
        the shell background black, with green text.) </li>
</ul>
</p>
