<h2>Output as input</h2>

<p>To redirect a certain output of the command-line we have to use the symbol "&gt;".<br>

In this case, we will use a file named "<i>hello.txt</i>", in which we want to insert
a certain output ("Sun" in this case):<br>

<pre>
echo "Sun" > hello.txt
</pre>

So if we print the content of the file in our command-line, the output will be the following:
<pre>
cat hello.txt
Sun
</pre>

If we want to append a certain output to an existing file,
we just have to use "&gt;&gt;" symbols:</p>

<pre>
cat hello.txt
Sun
echo "Moon" >> hello.txt
cat hello.txt
Sun
Moon
</pre>

<h2>Input as output</h2>

To redirect an input from a file for a command, the symbol "&lt;" is used.

<pre>
echo < $(cat hello.txt)
Sun
Moon
</pre>

This is particularly useful when chaining commands.
