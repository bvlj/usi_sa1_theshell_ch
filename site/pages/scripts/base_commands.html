    <!-- Echo command text -->
    <h3>Echo</h3>
    <p>This command print as output its entire argument on the command-line.<br>
    It could be used with variables, like in the following example:</p>
    <pre>
    $ example:"this is an example"
    <br>
    $ <b>echo</b> $example<br>
    this is an example
    <pre>
    <br>
    <!-- Cat command text -->
    <h3>Cat</h3>
    <p>This command prints the content of a certain file as an output on the command-line.</p>
    <p>As example, we could imagine a simple text file in pages named "Hello", which contains the line "Hello World".<br>
      So, our command example will look like this:</p>
    <pre>
    $ pages Hello
    $ <b>cat</b> Hello<br>
      Hello World</p>
    <pre>
    <br>
    <!-- Grep command text -->
    <h3>Grep</h3>
    <p>This one behaves very similarly to the previus one, but in this case it prints only the lines matching a certain pattern.<br>
      In this we could imagine a certain text file "animals", which contains a list of animal-names.</p>
    <p>If we want to select only the animals whose name begins with the letter "d", we will write this:<br>
    <hr>
    <p>$ grep d animals<br>
      Deer<br>
      Dog<br>
      Dolphin<br>
      ...
      <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
