    <!-- Echo command text -->
<h2>Echo</h2>

<p>This command print as output its entire argument on the command-line.<br>
    It could be used with variables, like in the following example:<br>

<pre>
$ example:"this is an example"
<br>
$ <b>echo</b> $example<br>
this is an example
</pre>
<br>


    <!-- Cat command text -->
<h2>Cat</h2>

This command prints the content of a certain file as an output on the command-line.<br>

As example, we could imagine a simple text file in pages named "Hello", which contains the line "Hello World".<br>
      So, our command example will look like this:<br>
<pre>
$ pages Hello
$ <b>cat</b> Hello<br>
  Hello World
</pre>
<br>


    <!-- Grep command text -->
<h2>Grep</h2>

This one behaves very similarly to the previus one, but in this case it prints only the lines matching a certain pattern.<br>
      In this we could imagine a certain text file "animals", which contains a list of animal-names.

If we want to select only the animals whose name begins with the letter "d", we will write this:<br>
<pre>
$ grep d animals<br>
  Deer<br>
  Dog<br>
  Dolphin<br>
  ...

</pre>
