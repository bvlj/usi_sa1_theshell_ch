<h1> Move Command </h1>
<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>mv -- move files</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
     <p>mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source target</p>
     <p>mv [-f | -i | -n] [-v] source ... directory</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>In its first form, the mv utility renames the file named by the source operand to the destination path named by the target operand.
This form is assumed when the last operand does not name an already existing directory.</p>

<p>In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to a destination file in the existing directory named by the directory operand.
The destination path for each operand is the pathname produced by the concatenation of the last operand, a slash, and the final pathname component of the named file.</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

 <p>-f

<p>Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination path. (The -f option overrides any previous -i or -n options.)

<p>-i

<p>Cause mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that would overwrite an existing file.  If the response from the standard input begins with the character `y' or `Y', the move is attempted.  (The -i option overrides any previous -f or -n options.)

<p>-n

<p>Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any previous -f or -i options.)

<p>-v

<p>Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.

<p>It is an error for either the source operand or the destination path to specify a directory unless both do.

<p>If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mv prompts the user for confirmation as specified for the -i option.

<p>As the rename(2) call does not work across file systems, mv uses cp(1) and rm(1) to accomplish the move.  The effect is equivalent to:
<ul>
<li>rm -f destination_path && \</li>
<li>cp -pRP source_file destination && \</li>
<li>rm -rf source_file</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>

<p>The command "mv dir/afile dir" will abort with an error message.<p>

LEGACY DIAGNOSTICS

<p>In legacy mode, the command "mv dir/afile dir" will fail silently, returning an exit code of 0.<p>

<p>For more information about legacy mode, see compat(5).<p>

<h2>SEE ALSO</h2>
<ul>
<li>cp(1)</li>
<li>rm(1)</li>
<li>symlink(7)</li>
</ul>
<h2>COMPATIBILITY</h2>

<p>The -n and -v options are non-standard and their use in scripts is not recommended.<p>

<p>The mv utility now supports HFS+ Finder and Extended Attributes and
resource forks.  The mv utility will no longer strip resource forks off of HFS files.  For an alternative method, refer to cp(1).</p>

<h2>STANDARDS</h2>

<p>The mv utility is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 (``POSIX.2'') compatible.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>A mv command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.</p>
