The <code>mv</code> command is used to move a file and directories from a given path to another.
If both files are in the same filesystem it will result as a renaming of the file<br>

<pre>
mv [-finv] source target
</pre>

<h3>Flags</h3>

<ul>
    <li> <b>-f</b>: Force overwriting  file(s) without asking a confirmation.</li>
    <li> <b>-i</b>: Request confirmation before overwriting the file(s).</li>
    <li> <b>-n</b>: Don't allow to overwrite existing file(s).</li>
    <li> <b>-v</b>: Cause mv to be verbose, showing files after they are moved.</li>
</ul>
