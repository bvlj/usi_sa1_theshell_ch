<p>
The <code>cd</code> command is used to change the working directory<br>
The name stands for <i>Change Directory</i>.<br>

The default cd command syntax is:

<pre>
cd [flags] [path]
</pre>

Where [flags] are the cd flags, read below for more info,and [path] is the
path (absolute or relative), of the directory which we  want to make as working directory.<br><br>

<h3>Change the working directory</h3>
Let's see how to use the command <code>cd</code> in order to change the working directory

<pre>
pwd
    ~
cd Desktop/multimedia
pwd
    ~/Desktop/multimedia
</pre>

As you can see, we changed the working directory from ~ (which stands for HOME),
to "multimedia". Now our Shell will work on the  directory "multimedia"
until a new <code>cd</code> will occour.<br>

<b> Notice:</b> If you want to move to a directory which is not contained in the
current working directory, you <u>MUST</u> use the absolute path.
