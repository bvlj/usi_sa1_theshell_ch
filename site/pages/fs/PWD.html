<p>
<code>pwd</code> (abbreviation of print working directory, it gives you the corrent directory) it is a command of the operation system Unix and Unix-like,
and in general of the systems POSIX, that show on the standard output the absolute pathname on the corrent directory.
Since a command line interface cannot provide graphic pictures of the file system structure, it must have a different way of representing it.
Think of the file system tree as a maze, and you are standing in it. At any given moment, you are located in a single directory.
Inside that directory, you can see its files and the pathway to its parent directory and the pathways to the subdirectories of the directory in which you are standing.
</p>
<p>
The working directory is the directory where you are standing in. So for
knowing where you are, you must use the pwd command.
</p>



<h2>Description</h2>
<p> The pwd utility writes the absolute pathname of the current working
directory to the standard output.
Some shells may provide a builtin pwd command which is similar or identical to this utility. </p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<ul>
<li> -L      Display the logical current working directory.</li>

<li>-P      Display the physical current working directory (all symbolic
        links resolved).</li>
</ul>
