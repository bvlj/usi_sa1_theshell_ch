<h1>ABSOLUTE VS RELATIVE</h1>

<p>
  Now, you can ask, why I have to use one or another?
  <br> What is the difference? and questions like this.
  <br> <br> <br> Don't worry, the answer it's easy.., we can use an absolute path from any location
  <br> whereas you want to use relative path we should be present that you have to be in the working directory.
