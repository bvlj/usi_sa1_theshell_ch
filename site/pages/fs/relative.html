Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory(pwd).<br>
Suppose I am located in /home/user and I want to change directory to /home/user/Documents.<br>
I can use relative path concept to change directory to Documents.

<pre>
pwd
  /home/user
cd Documents
pwd
  /home/user/Documents
</pre>

If you observe, there is a little bit difference between absolute and relative paths:
in relative paths there is no "/" at the very beginning.<br>
Meanwhile in an absolute path you have to write "/", in this case it'd be "/home/user/Documents".
