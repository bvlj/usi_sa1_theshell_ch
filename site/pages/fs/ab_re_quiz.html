<h1>ABSOLUTE VS RELATIVE</h1>

<p>
  Now, you can ask, why I have to use one or another?
  <br> What is the difference? and questions like this.
  <br> <br> <br> Don't worry, the answer it's easy.., we can use an absolute path from any location
  <br> whereas you want to use relative path we should be present that you have to be in the working directory.

Yeah, right, there is a quiz.
<br> The best way to learn something it's not the theory, in fact you have to do some practice, if you click
<br> the button "QUIZ", you can try to do a quiz in order to check what you've just read.
