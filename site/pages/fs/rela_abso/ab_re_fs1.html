<div class = "title1">
<h1>Relative Path!</h1>
</div>



<div class= "text1">
Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory(pwd).
<br>Suppose I am located in /home/user1 and I want to change directory to /home/user1/Documents.
<br>I can use relative path concept to change directory to Documents.
<br> <br> <br> <p>  pwd/home/user1cd Documents   </p>
</div>

<br> <br> <br> Then you could tell me what is the difference between Absolute and Relative.

<br> If you observe, there is a little bit difference, where in relative there is no "/".
<br> Meanwhyle using absolute path you have to write "/", in this case cd /home/user1/Documents.

<div class = "title2">
  <h2>Example of Relative path's uses:</h2>
  Now, as we learned from the previous pages we can use other commands in addition to "cat", such as:

  <br><br>pwd
  <br> cd .
  <br><br>pwd
  <br> cd ..
  <br><br>pwd
  <br> cd ..
  <br><br>pwd
  <br> cd

  <br><br><br> and so on.. I know, it's boring but it is one of the disadvantages of not being present in the
  <br>working directory


<h3> Now I will show you in many examples.</h3>
