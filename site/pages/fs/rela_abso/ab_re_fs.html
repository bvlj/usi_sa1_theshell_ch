<h1>Absolute Path!</h1>
</div>



<div class = "title2">
  <h2>First, what is a path?</h2>
</div>


<div class= "text1">
A path is a location to a folder or file in a file system of a Operating System, then is a combination of characters and "/"
</div>




<div class = "title3">
  <h3>Now, I can tell you what is an absolute path</h3>
</div>


<div class= "text2">
An absolute path is defined as specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/).
In other words we can say absolute path is a complete path from start of actual filesystem from / directory.
</div>





<div class = "title4">
  <h4>To write an absolute path-name:</h4>
</div>


<div class= "text3">
Start at the root directory ( / ) and work down.
<br>Write a slash ( / ) after every directory name (last one is optional)
</div>



<div class = "title5">
  <h5>Example:</h5>
</div>


<div class= "text4">
  <p> cat group1.txt  </p>
if for example, we use the above line, this commands work only and only if the "group1.txt" exist in the current directory.
<br> If not works, it's not a problem, the file is present somewhere, before restart the new command, you have to know where
<br> the file is saved.
<br> Now, we supposed that you know where your file is saved you can rewrite the command.
<p1> cat /home/a1/group1.txt  </p1>
Now, we suppose that the file is saved into folder a1 in home,
<br>where: /home is the location respect to root, in fact, you have to descend one level
<br>in the file system like above to access your file.

As you can see from the last commands, all the paths started from /directory whis is a root directory for every Unix machines.


<p2> Other examples, where all are absolute path </p2>


/home/user/Document/group1.txt
/root/data/dev.jpg
/var/log/messages
</div>


<div class = "title6">
  <h5>Example of Absolute path's uses:</h5>
  Now, as we learned from the previous pages we can use other commands in addition to "cat", such as:
  <br> chmod
  <br> ls
  <br> mv
  <br> get
  <br> text
  <br> rm
  and so on.. with the sintax like above.
