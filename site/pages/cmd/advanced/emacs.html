<p>Emacs is one of the oldest and most versatile text editors available for
   UNIX-based systems. It's been around for a long time (more than twenty years
   for GNU emacs) and is well known for its powerful and rich editing features.
    Emacs is also more than just a text editor; it can be customized and
    extended with different "modes", enabling it to be used like an
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages
    like Java, C or Python.<br><br>


For those who have used both the ubiquitous vi and the user-friendly nano,
emacs would come as an interesting cross-between. Its strengths and features
would resemble those of vi while its menus, help files and easy-to-remember
command-keys would compare with nano.<br><br>

In this article, we will see how we can install emacs
in a Linux system and use it for basic text editing. Emacs
 is also available for graphical window managers for Linux like
 GNOME; however we will only cover the "text based" version here.</p>

 <h3>How to install</h3>
<p> running the following command:
</p><pre>emacs</pre>
<p>else:</p>
<pre>install emacs</pre>

<br><br>
<p>Open a file, or create it like this:</p>
<pre> emacs file1.txt</pre>
<br>
<p> Follow the simple manual that will be open.</p>
