In computing, <code>echo</code> is a command in Unix operating systems that outputs the
strings it is being passed as arguments.<br>

It is a command typically used to output status text to the screen or a
computer file, or as a source part of a pipeline.<br>

To use this simple command just type "echo" with the topic we want to
print. The computer will return your argument as a string

<pre>
echo "hello world"
    hello world
</pre>
