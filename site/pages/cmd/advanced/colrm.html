The <code>colrm</code> is a command that removes the column that you indicate <br>

Here we have a file named <code>example.txt</code> that contains two lines to test this command:<br>

{% highlight bash linenos %}
123456789
abcdefghi
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax command is:
<pre>
colrm [first] [last]
</pre>

<pre>
colrm 4 &lt; example.txt
    123
    abc
</pre>

How you can see, if I don't indicate the last column, the command removes
all the colums starting from 4 included.
<pre>
colrm 2 4 &lt; example.txt
    156789
    aefghi
</pre>

Here, how you can see, the command has removed not all the columns, but only the colums that
starting at 2 and ending at 4, included.
