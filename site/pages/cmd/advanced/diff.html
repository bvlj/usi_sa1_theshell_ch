<p> diff analyzes two files and prints the lines that are different.
   Essentially, it outputs a set of instructions for how to change one file to
   make it identical to the second file.</p>







   <h3>How to use</h3>

     <p> To activate the diff command, we must take as parameters two or more
       files that we want to compare and it will give us the output of
        different lines. <br>
        For example let's say we have two files, file1.txt and file2.txt.<br>
        <br> If <b>file1.txt</b> contains the following four lines of text: </p>

<ol><code><li>I need to buy apples.</li>
<li>I need to run around the park.</li>
<li>I need to wash the dog.</li>
<li>I need to get the car detailed.</li></code></ol>

<p> ...and <b>file2.txt</b> contains these four lines: </p>

<ol><code><li> I need to buy apples.</li>
<li>I need to do the laundry.</li>
<li>I need to wash the dog.</li>
<li>I need to get the dog detailed.</li></ol></code>

<p>...then we can use diff to automatically display for us which lines differ
   between the two files with this command:</p>

   <pre>diff file1.txt file2.txt</pre>

   <p> ...and the output will be:</p>

   <pre> 2,4c2,4 <br>
< I need to run the laundry.<br>
< I need to wash the dog.<br>
< I need to get the car detailed.<br>
---<br>
> I need to do the laundry.<br>
> I need to wash the car.<br>
> I need to get the dog detailed.</pre>

<p> In our output above, "2,4c2,4" means: "Lines 2 through 4 in the first
  file need to be changed to match lines 2 through 4 in the second file.</p>







   <h3>Flags</h3>
   <ul>
     <li><h4> -c:</h4> <br>To view differences in context mode, use the -c option.
        For instance, let's say <b>file1.txt</b> and <b>file2.txt</b> contain
        the following:<br><br>

<table>
<tr>
      <th> File1.txt </th> <th>File2.txt</th></tr>
      <tr><td> apples </td> <td>apples</td></tr>
      <tr><td>oranges</td> <td>kiwis</td></tr>
      <tr><td>kiwis</td>   <td>carrots</td></tr>
      <tr><td>carrots</td>  <td>grapefruits</td></tr></table>









       <pre> diff -c file1.txt file2.txt </pre>

       Our output will be like the following:
  <pre>     *** file1.txt   2014-08-21 17:58:29.764656635 -0400<br>
--- file2.txt   2014-08-21 17:58:50.768989841 -0400<br>
***************<br>
*** 1,4 ****<br>
  apples<br>
- oranges<br>
  kiwis<br>
  carrots<br>
--- 1,4 ----<br>
  apples<br>
  kiwis<br>
  carrots<br>
+ grapefruits< </pre>

       The first two lines of this output show us information about our "from"
       file (file 1) and our "to" file (file 2). It lists the file name,
       modification date, and modification time of each of our files, one per
       line. The "from" file is indicated by "***", and the "to" file is
       indicated by "---"..<br>
     <br> The line "***************" is just a separator.
     <br><br> The next line has three asterisks ("***") followed by a line
     range from the first file (in this case lines 1 through 4, separated by
     a comma). Then four asterisks ("****").<br>
   <br> Then it shows us the contents of those lines. If the line is unchanged,
   it's prefixed by two spaces. If the line is changed, however, it's prefixed
   by an indicative character and a space. The character meanings are as
   follows:<br><br>





<table> <tr>
  <th>Character</th>
  <th>Meaning</th></tr>
  <tr> <td> <b>!</b></td>
    <td>Indicates that this line is part of a group of one or more lines that
      needs to change. There is a corresponding group of lines prefixed with
      "!" in the other file's context as well.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><b>+</b></td>
        <td>Indicates a line in the second file that needs to be added to the
          first file.</td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>-</b></td>
          <td>Indicates a line in the first file that needs to be deleted.</td>
          </tr>
        </table><br>

        After the lines from the first file, there are three dashes ("---"),
        then a line range, then four dashes ("----"). This indicates the
        line range in the second file that will sync up with our changes
        in the first file.<br><br>

        If there is more than one section that needs to change, diff will
        show these sections one after the other. Lines from the first file will
        still be indicated with "***", and lines from the second file
        with "---".

 </li>

  <li><h4> -u</h4>:Unified mode (the -u option) is similar to context mode,
         but it doesn't display any redundant information. Here's an example,
         using the same input files as our last example:
        <pre>diff -u file1.txt file2.txt</pre>
         will output:<br>
         <pre> --- file1.txt   2014-08-21 17:58:29.764656635 -0400<br>
+++ file2.txt   2014-08-21 17:58:50.768989841 -0400<br>
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@<br>
 apples<br>
-oranges<br>
 kiwis<br>
 carrots<br>
+grapefruits</pre>

The output is similar to above, but as you can see, the differences are
 "unified" into one set.
