The program reads either standard input or a list of files and
generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count,
word count, and byte count. If a list of files is provided, both
individual file and total statistics follow.

<h3>How to use</h3>
Sample execution of wc:

<pre>
wc file1.txt file2.txt
</pre>

will output:

<pre>
      40      149      947     file1.txt
    2294    16638    97724    file2.txt
    2334    16787    98671    total
</pre>

The first column is the count of newlines, meaning that the text file
<code>file1.txt</code> has 40 newlines while bar has 2294 newlines-
resulting in a total of 2334 newlines. The second column indicates the
number of words in each text file showing that there are 149 words in <code>file1.txt</code>
and 16638 words in <code>file2.txt</code> – giving a total of 16787 words.<br>
The last column indicates the number of characters in each text file, meaning that the file
<code>file1.txt</code> has 947 characters while bar has 97724 characters – 98671
characters all in all.<br>
