<p>The program reads either standard input or a list of files and
  generates one or more of the following statistics: newline count,
   word count, and byte count. If a list of files is provided, both
   individual file and total statistics follow.</p>

   <h3> How to use</h3>
   <p>Sample execution of wc:</p>
   <pre> wc file1.txt file2.txt</pre>
   <p>will output:</p>
   <pre>
     40      149      947     file1.txt<br>
    2294    16638    97724    file2.txt<br>
    2334    16787    98671    total</pre>

    <p>The first column is the count of newlines, meaning that the text file
      <code>file1.txt</code> has 40 newlines while bar has 2294 newlines-
      resulting in a total
      of 2334 newlines. The second column indicates the number of words in each
       text file showing that there are 149 words in <code>file1.txt</code>
       and 16638 words in
       <code>file2.txt</code> – giving a total of 16787 words. The last
       column indicates the
       number of characters in each text file, meaning that the file
        <code>file1.txt</code> has
       947 characters while bar has 97724 characters – 98671 characters all
       in all.</p>

       <h3>Flags</h3>
       <pre>wc -l file1.txt</pre>
       <p>prints the line count (note that if the last line does not have \n,
       it will not be counted).<p>
       <pre>wc -c file1.txt</pre>
       <p>prints the byte count.</p>
       <pre>wc -m file1.txt</pre>
       <p> prints the character count</p>
        <pre>wc -L file1.txt</pre>
        <p>prints the length of longest line (GNU extension)</p>
      <pre>wc -w file1.txt</pre>
      <p> prints the word count.</p>
