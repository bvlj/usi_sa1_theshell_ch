<p>
Once the MacOS Terminal app has been opened, a menu bar will appear exactly in the upper
left corner of the screen. This menu contains some preferences that could improve the user
experience and use of the Terminal.<br>
The menu is divided into 6 sections that I will describe briefly to give you a basic knowledge
that could be very useful once you have become familiar with the program.

<h3>Terminal</h3>

<img src="" alt="Terminal section" height="">

<ul>
    <li><b>Secure Keyboard Entry</b>:
        Inside the Terminal section you will find the item “secure Keyboard Entry”, this tool
        allows the user to enable an additional system security.<br>
        Essentially, this option prevents other Application from seeing what you are
        typing on the shell.<br>
        It also prevents processes that are working in background from
        monitoring your keystrokes.<br>
        In a first moment it seems that it doesn’t do anything, that’s because for
        people who works on their own personal computer, this additional secure may
        become an unnecessary precaution.<br>
        However, this option could be very useful if you using an unknown computer
        or a public computer.
    </li>
    <li><b>Hide terminal</b>:
        Although Shell’s window does not take a lot of space, it is possible to hide
        the window by pressing <code>⌘ + H</code>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Hide Others</b>:
        In the other hand, it’s possible to hide all the others windows (except the Terminal) by
        pressing  <code>⌥ + ⌘ + H</code>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Quit Terminal</b>:
        Once you have finished working with the Terminal, you can definitely close it by
        pressing  <code>⌘ + Q</code>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Shell</h3>

<img src="" alt="Shell section" height="">

  <ul>
    <li><b>New Window</b>: It creates a new window.</li>
    <li><b>New Tab</b>: It creates a new tab</li>
    <li><b>Close window</b>: This option closes the window without quitting the terminal.</li>
    <li><b>Show Inspector</b>:
        This option allows the user to customise the layout of the shell.
        This option contains some profiles that you can use instead of spending
        time to create your own one.<br>
        This option is not permanent, once the terminal has been quitted, the shell is set
        with the default settings.
    </li>

    <li><b>Edit Title</b>:
        This options shows the inspector too, but it selects the current title that
        you want to change
    </li>
    <li><b>Edit Background Colour</b>:

    <li><b>Hard Reset</b>: This option re-initialize completely the terminal.</li>
    <li><b>Print Selection</b>:

<ul>
    <li><b>Undo</b>: Undo the last input action.</li>
    <li><b>Redo</b>: Redo the last undone input action.</li>
    <li><b>Cut</b>:
        Traditionally, the cut command was designed to move texts within applications, but,
        according to the Mac user community, it’s not very intuitive.<br>
        There is a much easier alternative way, the copy and paste,
        known as <code>⌘ + C</code> (copy) and <code>⌘ + V</code> (paste).
    <li><b>Copy</b>: Copy the selected text.</li>
    <li><b>Copy Special</b>:
        It copy a selected text by giving you more options.
        For example, if you have a black background, copy special allows you to copy a
        selected file without considering the colour of the background
    </li>
    <li><b>Paste</b>: Past the text from the system clipboard.</li>
    <li><b>Paste Escaped Text</b>:
        If you want to copy a text with special symbols, precisely code text,
        you have to use paste escaped text to maintain the text intact and not have characters
        interpreted as code.
    </li>
    <li><b>Select All</b>: It selects all the content of the shell.</li>
    <li><b>Select Between Marks</b>: It selects a portion of the text between marks.</li>
