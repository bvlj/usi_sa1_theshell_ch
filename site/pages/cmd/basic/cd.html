<p>The <code>cd</code> command is used to change the working directory<br>
  The name stands for <i>Change Directory</i>. </p>
  <h2>Syntax</h2>
  <p>The default cd command syntax is:
    <pre>cd [flags] [path]</pre>
    Where [flags] are the cd flags, read below for more info,and [path] is the
    path (absolute or relative), of the directory which we  want to make as working directoty</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2> <br>
    <h3> Change the working directory</h3>
    <p> Let's see how to use the command <code> cd </code> in order to change the working directory</p>
    <pre>
      Device-Name:~ YourName$ cd Desktop/Multimedia.Folder/
      Device-Name:Multimedia.Folder YourName$
  </pre>
<p> As you can see, we changed the working directory from ~ (which stands for HOME),
  to <code>Multimedia.Folder</code>. Now our Shell will work on the  directory <code>Multimedia.Folder</code>
  until a new <code>cd</code> will occour. </p>
  <p> <b> Notice: </b> If you want to move to a directory which is not contained in <thead>
    current working directory, you <u>MUST</u> use the absolute path.</p>
