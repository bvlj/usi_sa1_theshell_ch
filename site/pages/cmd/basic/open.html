You can open files and folder as new windows through the terminal.
The command is <code>open</code>. By writing the command open followed by the
path and the name of the file (remember that you can omit the path if
the file is in the current position), a new window in the common user
interface opens. Now you can work on the opened file.

<pre>
open path/name-file
</pre><br>

<h3>Open a file with a specific application</h3>
Adding the flag <code>-a</code> to the command permit you to decide with
which specific application open the file. Just write the flag followed by the
name of the application.

<pre>
open -a application-name path/name-file
</pre>

Assume that you want to open the file <i>abc.pdf</i> on my Desktop using the program "preview".

<pre>
open -a preview Desktop/abc.pdf
</pre>

As result, a new <i>Preview</i> window appears showing the content of the
chosen file.<br>

<h3>Open the folder which contains the file</h3>
If you want to open the folder that contains a specific file, just use
the flag <code>-R</code> and write the path and the name of the file you want to open.

<pre>
open -R Desktop/text.txt
</pre>

As result, a new <i>Finder</i> window opens the folder displaying its content.<br><br>

<h3>Open a file with an editor</h3>
If you want to open a file with your default editor,
just use the flag <code>-t</code> and write the path and the name of
the file you want to open.

<pre>
open -t Desktop/text.txt
</pre>

<h3>Visit a Website</h3>
You can use this tool not only to open files and folders, but also webpages.
Just write the command <code>open</code> followed by the <i>URL</i> of the page
you want to visit.

<pre>
open http://www.google.com
</pre>

A new page of your default browser will open on the indicated page (in this
example, the main page of the Google Search Engine).
