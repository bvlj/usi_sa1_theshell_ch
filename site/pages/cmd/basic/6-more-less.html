Both commands show the content of one or more files and it’s possible to do a research with
particular flags, but the “less” one allows us to go also backwards while reading the text
of a file.<br>
More is quite old, less is more recent and powerful.<br>

General syntax for both is:<br>

<pre>
less [flags] path/name-file.*
more [flags] path/name-file.*
</pre>

The command <code>less</code> provides some useful commands to navigate and modify the file content.
Commands does not include flags, which are included under Options.<br><br>
