<h1>SSH</h1>

<h2> What is "SSH"!?</h2>
<br>Are you searching for a program for executing commands on a machine remotely or simply logging into a remote machine?
<br>Are you searching a program that provide you secure encryption communications between two host?
<br> I have the solution, SSH.
<br> SSH connects and logs you into a specified hostname, where the user have only to prove his identity to the remote machine.
<br> Briefly The ssh command provides a secure connection between two hosts over a insecure network.

<h3> Example of using ssh</h3>

-Logging to a remote server(to login in a remote server from local host)
<pre>

  localhost:[~]> ssh username@remote-server
  username@remote-server password:
  remote-server:[~]>

  </pre>
<br>
-Logging out from remote server(you can do easily "command+d")

<pre>

  remote-server:[~]>exit
  logout
  Connection to remote-server closed.
  localhost:[~]>


  </pre>

<br>
-Running remote from local host

<pre>

  localhost:[~]> ssh user@remote-host "ls test"
  online-backup.dat
  oracle-storage.bat
  unix-dedicated-server.txt

  </pre>

<br>
-Debugging ssh client(to debug and find the exact error without connection to the remote host)

<pre>
  ssh -v user@remote-host
 OpenSSH_4.3p2, OpenSSL 0.9.8e-fips-rhel5 01 Jul 2008
 debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config

 debug1: identity file /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa type -1
 debug1: identity file /home/user/.ssh/id_dsa type 2
 debug1: loaded 3 keys
 ..........

  </pre>

<br>
-Copying files between remote host and local

<br>
from remote
<pre>

scp user@remote-host:/usr/local/bin/add.sh
  </pre>

<br>
from local

<pre>
scp filename user@remote-host:/var/tmp/
</pre>



</p>
