<p>Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands
  read from the standard input or from a file. Bash also incorporates useful
  features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh). Bash is intended to be a
  conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX
  specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).</p>

    <h3> Flags </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>-c: If this option is present, then commands are read from
              string.  If there are arguments after the  string,  they  are
              assigned to the positional parameters, starting with $0.</li>
      <li>-i: If this option is present, the shell is interactive.</li>
      <li>-l: Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell</li>
      <li>-r: If this option is present,  the  shell  becomes  restricted</li>
      <li>-s: If this option is present, or if no arguments remain after
              option processing, then commands are read from  the  standard
              input.   This  option  allows the positional parameters to be
              set when invoking an interactive shell.</li>
      <li>-s: List only the name, line and time fields.  This is the default.</li>
      <li>-T: Print a character after the user name indicating the state of the
           terminal line: `+' if the terminal is writable; `-' if it is not;
           and `?' if a bad line is encountered.</li>
      <li>-u: Print the idle time for each user, and the associated process ID.</li>
      <li>am I: Returns the invoker's real user name.</li>
      <li>file: By default, who gathers information from the file /var/run/utmpx.
          An alternative file may be specified.</li>
    </ul>
