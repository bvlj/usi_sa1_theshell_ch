The <code>fg</code> command allows us to continue a stopped operation by running it in foreground.
<br>

<br>
The command name stands for <i>foreground</i>.<br><br>

<h3>Usage</h3>

The default fg command syntax is:

<pre>
fg [%job_number]
</pre>

The parameter [%job_id] contains the job number you wish to run in foreground. If this is not indicated,
the command will run the last stopped operation.
