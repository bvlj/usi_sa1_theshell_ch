The strings command returns each string of printable characters (ASCII)
in files. Its main uses are to determine the contents of and to extract text
from binary files (i.e., non-text files). From the Shell manual: "find the
printable strings in a object, or other binary, file".<br>

Strings can be used to extract character information and string of a given lenght
from text file(s). When used without any options, strings displays all strings
that are at least four characters in length in the files whose names are
supplied as arguments (i.e., input data). Strings that are on separate lines
in the input files are shown on separate lines on the screen, and an attempt
is made to display all strings found on a single line in a file on a single
line on the screen (although there may be a carryover to subsequent lines in
the event that numerous strings are found on a single line). strings looks in
all sections of the object files except the (__TEXT,__text) section.<br>
