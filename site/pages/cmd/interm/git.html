If you want to use <i>Git</i> on the shell you need to know how this command works (usually it is preinstalled on Mac and Linux).<br>
The <i>git</i> command providesa set of high-level operations and full access to internals.

Here is the basic syntax but sometimes you will may have some more complicated:
</p>

<pre>
    git [flags] [path]
</pre>

First of all, you need to know if you have the right version of git with:

<pre>
    git --version
</pre>

Now that we know that we have the right version, we can move to the common <code>git</code> flags used.
I will divide commands in different type of operation.<br>

<h3>Start a working area</h3>
<ul>
    <li>clone: is used to clone a repository in a new directory.</li>
    <li>init: this onw is used to create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work on the current changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>add: add a file contents to the index.</li>
    <li>mv: move or renamea file, directory or a symlink (a symbolic link).</li>
    <li>rm: remove files from the working tree and from the index.</li>
    <li>format-patch id(commit): create a file patch</li>
    <li>am: apply a patch file</li>
</ul>

<h3>History and state</h3>
<ul>
    <li>log: show commit logs.</li>
    <li>status: show the working tree status.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing modification</h3>
<ul>
    <li>commit: record changes to the repository.</li>
    <li>diff: show changes between commits.</li>
    <li>merge: merge two or more development histories together.</li>
    <li>pull: fetch from and update your local directory with the repository.</li>
