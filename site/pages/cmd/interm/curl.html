  The <code>curl</code> command is a fast and versatile shell program that can
  request online content using various protocols, including <em>HTTP</em>,
  <em>FTP</em> and <em>POP3</em>. Some example use cases for this utility are 
  the need to automate some remote call to a server, testing <em>REST</em> or
  <em>SOAP</em> apis or simply download or display the <em>HTML</em> code of a 
  website.
</p>

<p>
  The name, as mentioned in the <a href="https://ec.haxx.se/curl-name.html">
    <em>Evertything curl</em></a> online book, stands for <em>"client URL"</em>
  and the right pronunciation rhymes with "earl" or "girl". By this fact, the
  reader is able to tell the author of this page to stop pronuncing it as 
  <em>"cooorl"</em>, like if the name is some sort of word in the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamasque_dialect"><em>Bergamasque
      dialect</em></a>.
