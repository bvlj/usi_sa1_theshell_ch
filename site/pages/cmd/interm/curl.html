The <code>curl</code> command is a fast and versatile shell program that can
request online content using various protocols, including <i>HTTP</i>,
<i>FTP</i> and <i>POP3</i>. Some example use cases for this utility are
the need to automate some remote call to a server, testing <i>REST</i> or
<i>SOAP</i> apis or simply download or display the <i>HTML</i> code of a
website.

The name, as mentioned in the <a href="https://ec.haxx.se/curl-name.html">
<i>Evertything curl</i></a> online book, stands for <i>"client URL"</i>
and the right pronunciation rhymes with "earl" or "girl". By this fact, the
reader is able to tell the author of this page to stop pronuncing it as
<i>"cooorl"</i>, like if the name is some sort of word in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamasque_dialect"><i>Bergamasque
dialect</i></a>.
