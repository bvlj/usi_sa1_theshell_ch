The <code>scp</code> command name stands for <i>Secure CoPy</i>.<br>
As the name suggests it's similar to the <code>cp</code> command,
with the main difference being that while <code>cp</code> is used to move files
in a local machine, <code>scp</code> will also operate on the remote systems.<br>

The syntax is similar to the one of the <code>cp</code> command.

<pre>
scp ~/Documents/list.txt protocol://user@myhost.com:/home/user/Documents/list.txt
</pre>

Keep in mind that <code>protocol://user@myhost.com</code> should be changed accordingly to
your use case and may require authentication on the remote server.<br>
It's also possible to download files in a similar way.

<pre>
scp protocol://user@myhost.com:/home/user/Documents/list.txt ~/Downloads/list.txt
</pre>

And it can also operate on the remote host only:
<pre>
scp protocol://user@myhost.com:/home/user/Documents/list.txt protocol://user@myhost.com:/home/user/Download/shopping.txt
</pre>
