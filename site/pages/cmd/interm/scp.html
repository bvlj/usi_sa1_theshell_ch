<h1>SCP</h1>
<h2>What is SCP?</h2>
I think that you are familiar with "cp command", so SCP stand for "secure copy".
<br> You have to know that the only difference between "cp" and "scp" is that you use cp command into your
<br> local machine and scp if one or both the location are on the remote system.

<pre>

cp /home/SA/course/images.jpg /home/SA/MY

  </pre>

As you can see from the example above we use cp, to copy images from folder course into folder "MY"
<br>

Now, we see the same example but using scp command

<pre>

scp /home/SA/course/images.jpg  marwan@myhost.com:/home/SA/MY

</pre>

Where marwan it's just an example(my real name..), you have to use you real host.
<br> This operation require passsword before upload.

<pre>
scp marwan@myhost.com:/home/SA/My/image1.jpg /home/SA/downloads


</pre>

As you can see from the above example, with this command you can download image1.jpg from remote
<br> directory to your local (in this case downloads folder)


<pre>

scp marwan@myhost.com:/home/user/dir1/sa.txt marwan@myhost.com:/home/SA/course


</pre>

In this example we move sa.txt from remote directory to another remote directory.


<br><h3>Other example of using scp with options</h3>

You have to know that you can use scp command with some options, such as -1, -2 and so on.

<pre>
<p>-1 to use scp with protocol 1 </p>
<p>-2 to use scp with protocol 2 </p>
<p>-3 to copy between 2 remote passing through local(like example above) </p>
<p>-4 to use scp with IPv4 addresses </p>
<p>-6 Guess..? to use scp with Ipv6 addresses </p>
<p>-C to enable compression of the encrypted connection </p>
<p>-c to encrypt data transfer (C and c is not the same options) </p>



</pre>

<p>Good, now you are able to copy and move files between remote system</p>
