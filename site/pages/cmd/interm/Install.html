The file(s) are copied to the target file or directory. If the destination
is a directory, then the file is copied into directory with its original
filename.  If the target file already exists, it is either renamed to
file.old if the -b option is given or overwritten if permissions allow.<br>
An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the -B option's argument.<br>
Basic syntax is in the form

<pre>
install [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
</pre><br>

This line of code copies all .xyz file from <i>/source/folder</i> to <i>/destination/folder</i>

<pre>
install -D /source/folder/*.xyz /destination/folder
</pre><br>
