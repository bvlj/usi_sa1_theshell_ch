<p>The <code>tee</code> command is used to split the output of a program, doing
this the output can be displayed in the shell and in the same time written in a
file. This is useful, for example, if we want to capture intermediate outputs of
a long program.
The command is named after the T-splitter used in plumbing, because they have
similar functions.</p>
<br>

<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p>The default tee command syntax is:</p>

<pre>tee [flags] [file]</pre>

<p>Where <code>[flags]</code> are the tee flags (below you will find more info),
and argument <code>[file]</code> is a file or a list of files, each of which
receives the output.</p>
<br>

<h3>Flags:</h3>

<p>The most common flags of tee are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-a</code> Appends the output to each file, rather than overwriting it.</li>
  <li><code>-i</code> Ignores interrupt signals.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<pre>date | tee example.txt</pre>

<p>Basically, with this example, we can see that tee writes the date in
example.txt, but shows also the output (in this case the date) in the shell.
If you wouldnâ€™t your file be overwritten every time you use this command,
you should use <code>-a</code> that appends the output to the file.</p>
