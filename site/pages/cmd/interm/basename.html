<p>The <code>basename</code> command deletes any prefix ending with the last slash "/" character
present in string and also a suffix.

<h2>Usage</h2>

The default basename command syntax is:

<pre>
basename [flags] [string] [suffix]
</pre>

Where [flags] are the cat flags, read below for more info, the string command is
the pathname and the suffix, if indicated, will be also deleted.

<h2>Flags</h2>

Here are some of the most common basename flags:

<ul>
    <li> <b>-a</b>: Every aregument is treated as a string </li>
    <li> <b>-s</b>: The suffix is taken as its argument  </li>
    <li> <b>-a</b>: Supports multiple arguments and they will be treated as a name </li>
</ul>

</p>
