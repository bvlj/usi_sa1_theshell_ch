  <h1>Welcome to The Shell website!</h1>

<p>And maybe, maybe, maybe... I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>

<p>We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>

<p>La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. You gotta think like a tree. You're meant to have fun in life.</p>
